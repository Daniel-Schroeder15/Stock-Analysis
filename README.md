# Stock-Analysis

###Challenge

  The excel file has stock data from 12 different companies in 2017 and 2018. The excel sheet titled, "AllStocksAnalysis" allows you to click on the "Run Analysis for All Stocks" and "Clear Worksheet" button. 
  
  Press the "Run Analysis for All Stocks" button to see the totaly daily value and return for each ticker based on the 2017 or 2018 worksheets. You will need to input "2017" or "2018" once prompted after clicking the button.
  
  Press the "Clear Worksheet" button to clear all cells. 
  
  2017 looks like it was a much better year for stocks in general. DQ had the highest precent return in 2017, but the also had the biggest loss of return in 2018. If Steve's parent can stomach the volitality and risk, DQ could be OKAY.
